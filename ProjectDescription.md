# Starter Kit Installation
In this term, you'll use Python 3 for programming quizzes, labs, and projects. The following will guide you through setting up the programming environment on your local machine.

There are two ways to get up and running:
1. Anaconda
2. Docker

We recommend you first try setting up your environment with Anaconda. It's faster to get up and running and has fewer moving parts.

If the Anaconda installation gives you trouble, try Docker instead.

Follow the instructions in [this README](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md).
